# Football Club website
 A website I'm making for football club management, data and theme adjusted to my personal favourite club: FC Bayern
 
 This is still a work in progress, especially when it comes to feeding data. Website construction is about 70% completed
 
 How to run:
 1. create database fc_bayern and import fcbayern.sql file to get all tables and data
 2. open directory in terminal and activate virtual environment using command '$ source venv/bin/activate'
 3. run server with command '$ python3 manage.py runserver'
