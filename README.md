# Football Club website
 A website I'm making for football club management, data and theme adjusted to my personal favourite club: FC Bayern
 
 **Update:** TThis website is now hosted on vibez.pythonanywhere.com
 
 This is still a work in progress, especially when it comes to populating the database,(because its huge). Website construction is about 95% completed.
 Bootstrap website template I've downloaded and tweaked to my preference, so I didn't do much work on the frontend.
 But backend is written from scratch entirely by myself, there are some future improvements I've listed down and will continue as soon as possible.
 
 Requirements:
 Any Linux/MacOS operating system with python and MySQL installed(the process is a bit more complicated on windows)
 
 How to run:
 1. create database fc_bayern and import fcbayern.sql file to get all tables and data
 2. open directory in terminal and activate virtual environment using command '$ source venv/bin/activate'
 3. run server with command '$ python3 manage.py runserver'
